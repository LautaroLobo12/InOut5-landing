    <h1>InOut</h1>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>Our privacy policy is aimed at making our online personal data practices more transparent out of respect to the privacy of people visiting and using our websites. Specifically, it describes what information we collect, how we collect it, and who has access to it. Most of this information is common sense, however we believe firmly in giving people the right to know how their information is being used.
      </p>
    <p>Our policy applies to websites InOut owns and controls, including hackinout.co and its related subdomains. It does not apply to the personal data practices of our sponsors’ and partner organizations’ sites. Finally, the policy is subject to change at any time at the sole discretion of InOut without notice.</p>
    <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
    <p>All of the personal information we collect on users can be categorized into one of four areas.</p>
    <h3>1. PERSONAL INFORMATION OF APPLICANTS AND ATTENDEES</h3>
      <p>When you register for an account on app.hackinout.co in order to apply to attend InOut, you willingly provide us with information as part of your application and as part of forms you submit leading up to, during, and after our event. Unless specified below, this information is not shared with anybody outside of the InOut organizing team and is used only for application review and for purposes directly related to running our hackathon.</p>
    <h3>2. ANALYTICS INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>InOut uses Google Analytics to gather data about our sites’ users. This information is anonymized and used only to observe general patterns so that we can enhance our practices and user experience. For more information about Google Analytics, check out the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a>.</p>
    <h3>3. SECURITY LOGGING INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>InOut logs limited personal information such as user account information, the user’s IP address, and the web browser user agent whenever certain actions such as logging in and resetting a password are performed. This information is only used to locate and prevent unauthorized access and is never shared with anybody outside of the InOut organization.</p>
    <h3>4. REIMBURSEMENT INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>If you qualify for travel reimbursements, you may be required to submit proof of your purchase as well as completed and signed forms and copies of identifying documents. This is required under InOut’s disbursement policy and is never shared with anyone outside of the InOut organization.</p>
    <h2>WHAT WE SHARE AND WHO WE SHARE IT WITH</h2>
    <p>The privacy and safety of our applicants and participants are always our highest concern. As a result, we want you to be aware of what information we share with our partners and sponsors.</p>
    <h3>OUR SPONSORS</h3>
    <p>The primary motivators for why sponsoring companies attend and support InOut is to interact with our great participants. In return for their support, we provide certain sponsors with access to the following information about our hackers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email</li>
      <li>Resume</li>
      <li>Github Username</li>
      <li>LinkedIn Profile</li>
      <li>Institute</li>
      <li>Branch</li>
      <li>Graduating year</li>
      <li>Any awards you may have won at the current or past InOut</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Specifically, we never directly share your phone number or any demographic information. In case you don't was to share your information, let us know by email.</p>
    <h2>LEGAL PURPOSES</h2>
    <p>Finally, we may share personal information with law enforcement and a court of law upon specific request to and beyond the extent required by law.</p>
